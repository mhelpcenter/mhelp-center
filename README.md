# Mission
The three pillars (policy, research, and education) are inextricably linked and all work together to promote human flourishing through scientific discovery. Each pillar is necessary for the other pillars to function well and together sum up the primary goals of the lab. Our research informs our policy work and gives us credentials for advocacy. The policy work supports and informs the research agenda as well as provides opportunities for students. The students provide labor, ideas, and a broad network of thoughtful individuals solving these problems together.
